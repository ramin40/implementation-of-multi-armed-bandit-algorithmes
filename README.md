## multi-armed bandit problem 
multi-armed bandit problems are the simplest kind of reinforcement learning problems because in these problems we just have one state and actions don't have any sequential and long-term effect you can read more about multi-armed bandit [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-b72de40db97c).
## implemented algorithms
implemented algorithms in this repository are:
- greedy policy.
- epsilon-greedy policy.
- gradiant bandit algorithm.
- UCB algorithm.
- thopson sampling (Bayesian  bandit).
## theoretical background.
the theory behind this implementation is chapter 2 of  [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) book.
## environment
I used 10 armed bandit described on page 30 of RL book.
pythone code implemented by [JKCooper](https://github.com/JKCooper2) in [this repository](https://github.com/JKCooper2/gym-bandits).
## how to run code
- install **numpy** and **matplotlib** libraries.
- clone [this repository](https://github.com/JKCooper2/gym-bandits) and read installation guide to install bandit environment.
- run **bandit_algorithems** notebook.
- heve fun :wink:
